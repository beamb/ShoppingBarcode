Extended the **MMAD2021 ShoppingBarcode** found [here](https://github.itu.dk/jst/MMAD2021/tree/master/ShoppingBarcode)

Included [CameraX implementation](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/camerax-getting-started#0) and relied on [this tutorial for a Java implemetation](https://medium.com/swlh/introduction-to-androids-camerax-with-java-ca384c522c5)

Followed the **ML Kit** instructions to scan barcodes using the device camera: [Scan Barcodes with ML Kit on Android](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/vision/barcode-scanning/android#java)

Relied on [Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide (3rd Edition)](https://www.bignerdranch.com/books/android-programming-the-big-nerd-ranch-guide/) **Chapter 5** to correctly handle intent results. Same information can be found in this year's online resources [here](https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/AndroidIntent/article.html#retrieving-result-data-from-a-sub-activity).
